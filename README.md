# key-detection-evaluation
Basic key detection and evaluation system for a given monophonic melodic audio

Executing the .py file will read the dataset and estimate the key of the given audio.

The system follows the following steps-
1. Reads audio
2. Computes STFT
3. Estimates tuning frequency
4. Extracts pitch chroma and detects the key
